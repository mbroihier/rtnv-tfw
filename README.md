# rtnv-tfw - Real Time Net Value Test Framework

This repository contains a test framework that I have used for testing software projects.  It is specifically staged for Heroku.  The framework has evolved over many years and continues to do so.  Recently, I wrote this base set of tools to build HTLM documents in C++, Java, and Python (2 & 3) using a DOM based paradigm.  Each tool set (ie C++, Java, and Python) is meant to implement the same set of tools.  I did this to brush up on my skills for each language and to give myself options as I proceed to deploy this framework to different platforms.  This set of tools is void of emulators and simulations that I've used on other projects.  With a little reflection, it becomes obvious how powerful this paradigm becomes as test cases are produced automatically by emulations and simulations of the system under test.
